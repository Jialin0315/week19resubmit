##Overview of the analysis: 


-Use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.










##Results:


  - Target was set to whether applicants will be successful.
  
  
  - Features were set to other features within the data set, except categorical variables.
  
  
  - 2 layers, one with 80 neurons, the other with 30 neurons were select for the neural network model. After optimization, 3 layers, each with 100, 50 and 25 neurons were applied to increase accuracy. Model check point and call back objects were also set up to save the model weights.
  
  
  -

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?






##Summary: 


  -After multiple rounds of adjustment and test, the accuracy of the trained model was always limited at 52%.
  
 
  -The accuracy using the neural network model is very hard to reach over 75%, which is not recommended for a classification prediction task require a high accuracy. Random forest model could be a alternative model to use for the target of achieving higher accuracy.
